Coefficient Interpretation:

Intercept = -11.782
med1000.2 = 0.057
GINI2016 = 31.945
Nonwhite = -3.862

Intercept -> For the average state with a median household income of $61,373, no income inequality, and where the entire population is white, we predict that there will be -11.782 hate crimes per 100,000 population. 

med1000.2 -> For the average state, we predict that an increase of \$1,000 in median household income is associated with an increase in 0.057 hate crimes per 100,000 population after accounting for income inequality and the percentage of the population that is nonwhite. 

GINI2016 -> For the average state, we predict that an increase in 0.01 points on the GINI index is associated with an increase of 0.319 hate crimes per 100,000 population after accounting for the median household income and the percentage of the population that is nonwhite. 

Nonwhite -> For the average state, we predict that an increase in 1 percentage point of population that is nonwhite is associated with a decrease of 0.039 hate crimes per 100,000 population after accounting for median household income and income inequality.
