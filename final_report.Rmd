Hate crimes target people for their identity, whether for their race, religion, sexuality, ability, or other similar attribute. Concerningly, the annual number of hate crimes in the United States has increased in recent years. Some research has been done on the perpetration of hate crimes in this country, investigating factors that lead to an increase in the rate at which they occur. However, this research has not come to any empirical conclusions about hate crime perpetration. One common theory about the recent increase in hate crimes in the US stems from information about the 2016 presidential election. 

Four years ago, in 2016, the election of Donald Trump as president of the United States was met with a large amount of activity and conflict. Something observed alongside the election was a larger-than-expected increase in hate crimes across the United States. Some social scientists attributed part of this increase to a proposed "Trump Effect," where Trump's campaign and subsequent election are associated with the increase in hate crimes (Edwards & Griffin, 2018). Others attributed the rise directly to the "alt-right" movement, claiming that Trump's presence in the media has provided validation of their ideas (Bell, 2019). The strict numerical increase in hate crimes can be seen simply by looking at the numbers of hate crimes in the US by year (Fig. 1). Of course, this does not prove the Trump Effect's existence - the recent increase in hate crimes could be attributed to other factors. We seek to further investigate the factors that impact the rate at which hate crimes are perpetrated across the United States, using data from 2014 to 2018. In particular, we will explore whether the share of voters who voted for Trump in the 2016 presidential election directly impacts the hate crime rate. While this wouldn’t prove the Trump Effect, seeing a significant impact on behalf of the share of votes for Trump would be evidence supporting its validity.

p1 <- hate_counts %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = Year, y = Total_Hate_Crimes2)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(x = "Year", title = "Figure 1: Total Hate Crimes by Year", y = " ")

  labs(title = "Figure 2: ", y = "Percent Population with HS Degree", x = "Percent of White Population in Poverty")

grid.arrange(p1, p2, ncol = 2)
```

We began by constructing a dataset inspired by one utilized by FiveThirtyEight for an article written nearly four years ago (Majumder, 2017). The original dataset included a variety of information describing the population of each state, including both racial and economic demographics and the share of votes that went toward Donald Trump in the 2016 presidential election. While FiveThirtyEight's dataset contained demographic information from one point in time, we expanded on their dataset by collecting similar demographics but for every year from 2014 through 2018. Our data was sourced from the US Census Bureau, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Kaiser Family Foundation - a nonprofit which focuses on healthcare issues in the United States. (A full list of our variables and their descriptions can be found in the technical appendix.)

Our research process, after collecting all of our data, began with exploring the information we had. First, we investigated what factors have a relationship with our response variable, the number of hate crimes per 100,000 people. The most noticeable relationship was with median household income (Fig. 3). A state with a greater household income tends to have a higher rate of hate crimes. However, this relationship was influenced a little too much by a few outliers - these were states with extremely high levels of hate crimes. In fact, these points influenced many other trends we looked at as well. These outliers represent the District of Columbia (D.C.) during various years. There are many potential reasons for the drastic difference in the hate crime rates of D.C. These could be anything from a more robust reporting system to drastically different population demographics. Regardless, we decided to remove D.C. from our analyses because it had too much influence, allowing us to look specifically at the hate crime rates for the 50 states. The relationship between median household income and the rate of hate crimes remained important, even with D.C. excluded from our data (Fig. 4).


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}
p5 <- ggplot(data = hate_crimes, aes(x = med1000, y = hate_per)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "Figure 3:", y = "Hate Crimes per 100,000 Population", x = "Median Household Income by State")

p6 <- ggplot(data = hate2, aes(x = med1000, y = hate_per)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "Figure 4:", y = "Hate Crimes per 100,000 Population", x = "Median Household Income by State")

grid.arrange(p5, p6, ncol = 2)
```

We then continued exploring relationships between variables. We found a strong negative correlation between a state’s share of white residents in poverty and the share of the population with a high school degree (Fig. 2). This means that, given two states, if one has a higher percentage of white residents in poverty, that state is also likely to have a smaller percentage of the population with a high school degree. Perhaps unsurprisingly, a state’s share of nonwhite residents is highly correlated with the share of residents who are not US citizens (Fig. 5). Additionally, the share of white poverty in a state is associated with that state’s share of votes cast for Trump in 2016 (Fig. 6). This aligns with the general perception of conservatism and lack of educational access within the Deep South and the Appalachian states.

After exploring trends within our dataset, we began developing a model using a technique called multilevel linear regression. This allowed us to estimate the effect of various predictive variables on the hate crime rate of a state, while also accounting for correlation within states. That is to say, we might see more similarity in the hate crime rate within a state over time than across states in a given year. The multilevel structure of our model allowed us to account for these similarities. 


```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.width = 8, fig.height = 4}
p3 <- ggplot(data = hate2, aes(x = Noncitizen, y = Nonwhite)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "Figure 5:", y = "Percent of Population that is Nonwhite", x = "Percent of Population that is Noncitizen")

p4 <- ggplot(data = hate2, aes(x = White_Poverty, y = share_voters_voted_trump)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm") +
  labs(title = "Figure 6:", y = "Share of Voters who Voted for Trump", x = "Percent of White Population in Poverty")

grid.arrange(p3, p4, ncol = 2)
```

We constructed a wide variety of models to try to predict the hate crime rate, accounting for different demographics. However, we were unable to create a model where the share of voters that voted for Donald Trump was a significant predictor of the rate at which hate crimes are committed. This does not mean that Trump's increase in media presence is unrelated to the rise in hate crimes. As we saw earlier in Figure 1, there was a clear increase in the number of hate crimes committed in the United States starting in 2016 and moving into the start of Trump's presidency. Nevertheless, we did not find Trump's vote share to be relevant in predicting the hate crime rate in a given state or year. Instead, we found that the most significant model took into consideration the median household income within a state, the percent of a state’s population that is nonwhite, and the Gini index - a measure of income inequality within a state. Thus, some of the most important predictors of the rate of hate crimes are tied to a state’s economic demographics.

Our model indicates that socioeconomic factors have a large impact on the predicted increase in hate crime rates. An increase in median household income, as well as increased income inequality (as measured by the Gini index), are related to an increase in the predicted rate of hate crimes. and an increase in the share of a state’s population that is nonwhite is related to a decrease in the rate. However, this doesn’t mean that these are the only important factors in play. The model that we created explains less than half (43%) of the variation within our data, meaning that other factors also affect the frequency at which hate crimes occur. Although socioeconomic demographics greatly influence the hate crime rate, they are likely not the only elements at play.
While our modeling indicated that Trump’s vote share is not a significant predictor of the rate of hate crimes, there is a lot to consider regarding Trump's political presence in recent years. It is possible that accounting for the vote share for Trump in the 2020 US presidential election and expanding our study to cover a longer timespan would reveal a more nuanced relationship with the rate of hate crimes. However, that is not something that we’re currently able to determine. It’s also relevant to mention that although we did not find Trump's voter share to be a relevant predictor, the overall rate of hate crime perpetration in the United States increased greatly in 2016 and has remained higher than usual throughout the Trump presidency.

It’s important to note that our modeling results should not be generalized too much. The socioeconomic factors that we found to be important in predicting hate crime rates might not be as important when considering hate crimes in other countries, or even when trying to determine what factors were associated with hate crimes in the US ten years ago. Either of those situations would require data and analysis appropriate to the situation. There are also limitations to the research we’ve conducted. For example, our data on hate crime rates comes from the FBI, but those numbers are self-reported by police departments and by state. Without a universal approach to data collection, we can’t be sure that there isn’t bias built into our data through inconsistency between states.

Despite the limitations of this study, and although we didn’t find any evidence of the “Trump Effect,” our research still leads to important findings. The relationships we found between the rate of hate crimes and the income, income inequality, and nonwhite population share within a state are key to a greater understanding of what contributes to hate crimes, even if they aren’t a perfect explanation. More research should be done in particular on the relationship between income inequality and hate crimes, since our findings indicate that policies that counteract income inequality could help to reduce hate crime rates. By analyzing data from more recent years and taking into account Trump’s performance in the 2020 election, further research could overcome some of the limitations of our study, and could expand on the conclusions we have drawn.

## Technical Appendix

As mentioned in the main report, our data came from the US Census Bureau, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, and the Kaiser Family Foundation, with one additional variable taken from FiveThirtyEight’s original dataset. By using mutating joins in R, we created our original data which included the total number of hate crimes per state per year, the population of each state, and demographic information for each state, by year when possible. All of our variables and their descriptions can be found in the variable dictionary above.

Summary statistics for each key variable can be found in Table 1.

```{r, include = FALSE}

In order to compare hate crimes between states where population varies, we created a new variable for the rate of hate crimes per 100,000 population. We centered our median income variable around the mean and changed the units to 1000USD in order to get more interpretable modeling results. As mentioned in our report, the District of Columbia (D.C.) was an outlier in many demographics, and heavily influenced our analysis. D.C. is quite different from the other locations in our dataset, being the only non-state and having very unique demographics, which cause it to be an outlier in almost every variable. Because of this, we removed the 5 observations of D.C. from the dataset to look specifically at the 50 states. This left us with 250 total observations: one per state for each year from 2014 to 2018.

Given our longitudinal data structure, we used a multilevel linear model to represent our data. Through our exploratory data analysis, we noted apparent relationships between economic factors such as the median household income, the Gini index, the unemployment rate, and the rate of hate crimes. We also noticed a similar association between hate crime rate and the percent of the population that is non-white and non-citizen. We considered these relationships when fitting our model, but we were unable to fit a model where the share of voters that voted for Trump in the 2016 election was a significant predictor. Our final model instead accounted for median household income, the Gini index in 2016, and the percentage of the population that is nonwhite. 

\begin{center} $\widehat{\text{hate.per}} = -11.782 + 0.057 \text{med1000.2} + 31.945 \text{GINI2016} - 3.862 \text{Nonwhite} + u_i + \varepsilon_{ij}$ \end{center}

Parameter estimates and standard errors are found in Table 2.

```{r, echo = FALSE}
Variable <- c("Intercept", "med1000.2", "GINI2016", "Nonwhite")
Estimate <- c(-11.76299, 0.05708, 31.94519, -3.86226)
Std.Error <- c(4.58138, 0.01304, 10.12394, 1.19606)
t.value <- c(-2.568, 4.378, 3.155, -3.229)

fixed.effects <- data.frame(Variable, Estimate, Std.Error, t.value)

kable(fixed.effects, caption = "Table of Parameter Estimates")
```

```{r, echo = FALSE, fig.height = 3, fig.width = 3.5}
plot(hatecrimes14, main = "Scatterplot of Residuals")
hist(residuals(hatecrimes14), breaks = 30, cex.main=1.25, main = "Histogram of Residuals")
```

From examining the residual plot from our model, it was clear that the residuals follow a normal distribution, thus a linear model was appropriate, as the residuals showed no form.  We were slightly concerned about the equal variance assumption, but felt that a multilevel modeling structure was appropriate nonetheless. Our model was only able to account for about 43% of the variation in our data, and so there are many other variables that could play into the rate at which hate crimes are committed. From our model, we saw that in the average state, an increase of \$1,000 in median household income is associated with a predicted increase in 0.057 hate crimes per 100,000 population after accounting for income inequality and the percentage of population that is nonwhite. Further, an increase in 0.01 points on the Gini index is associated with a predicted increase of 0.319 hate crimes per 100,000 population after accounting for the median household income and the percentage of the population that is nonwhite.
